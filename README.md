Welcome to this simple command-line Blackjack game! This program allows you to play a basic version of the popular casino game Blackjack against the computer.

## How to get started
### Getting Started

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python installed.

### Running the Game
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
- Run the command: python Blackjack.py or python3 Blackjack.py depending on your Python setup.

## How does the game work?
### Objective:
- The goal of the game is to have a hand with a total score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

### Gameplay:

1. At the beginning of each round, you'll be prompted to place a bet using a portion of your available cash.

2. The dealer will then shuffle the deck and deal two cards to you.

3. Your hand's score is calculated based on the values of the cards. Number cards contribute their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) contribute 10, and Aces can be either 1 or 11.

4. You can choose to "hit" (receive an additional card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).

5. Be strategic in your decisions. If your total score exceeds 21, you "bust," and the round is lost.

6. After you decide to stand, the dealer reveals their hand and follows a set of rules. The dealer will keep hitting until their hand is 17 or higher.

7. The winner of the round is the one with a hand closest to 21 without busting.

### Scoring:
- If you have an Ace and a 10-value card (10, J, Q, K) in your initial two cards, you have a "blackjack" and win the round instantly.

### Betting:
- You start with a certain amount of cash. Adjust your bets wisely to maximize your winnings.

### Commands:
- Type "b" to start the game.
- Type "i" see instruction of the game before playing.
- Type "h" to receive another card.
- Type "s" to keep your current hand.
- Type "q" to quit game. 
- Type "easy", "medium" or "hard" to determine level of difficulty.
